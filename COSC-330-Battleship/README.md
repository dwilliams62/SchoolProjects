As a project for SU's COSC 330 class, OO Design Patterns and GUI/Event-Driven Programming, we were tasked with creating a fully working replica of the hit board game Battleship, including cross network functionality and drag-and-drop options on the U.I. as the most difficult parts to implement. Although the drag-and-drop functionality was unable to be completed, the network portions work as intended and the game fully runs, leading to a wonderful playing experience.
